Password Security

This repository contains my submission for **Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength** as part of the Cyber Security Internship.

 Objective
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different passwords using online strength checkers, and summarize best practices in password creation.

 Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/) (online free password strength checker)

 Contents
- `report.md` → Detailed report of password strength tests and findings
- `screenshots/` → Screenshots of password strength evaluations
- `README.md` → Overview of the task and repository

 Key Learnings
- Strong passwords require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Longer passwords are much harder to crack.
- Common words and predictable patterns weaken security.
- Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond just passwords.
